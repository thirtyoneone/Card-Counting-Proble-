# Card-Counting-Proble-
"Ok, problem I was debating at work  Let’s say I have 30 cards. 10x3, 10x2, 10x1 My opponent has the same  We play 30 rounds and each play one card per round. If my card is higher than my opponent, I get 1 dollar. If my card is less, I lose one dollar. If equal, 0 dollars My opponent plays randomly. If I pick my card every round based on what happened previously (but before seeing my opponents card this round) can I make money on average? (Clearly if I know what he will play beforehand I can make money, because I’ll play 1 to his 3, 3 to his 2, 2 to his 1)"
